done:

- changed grid to 0.1mm to help place components
- forced all components onto 0.1mm grid
- added gnd plane on bottom of board
- added two caps for decoupling the DAC+OP-AMP
- added 10K pull-up on the nCS line to the DAC

ideas:
- add LED on unused digital pin.


fixes
- IC1G2 swaped +/- input to make negative feedback

notes:

no decoupling on +5V (fixed)

no bulk decoupling on +12V or +5V
-> suggest 10uF 0805 on 5V near DAC
-> suggest 10uF near op-amp area
-> suggest 47uF or 100uF near the +12V transformer drive


bias for op-amps seem to be either 5V or 12V (not consistent)

if digital-io is not important then you could:
- 5->8
- 3->7

todo:
- check body-diode on pfets driving transformer centre-tap
 -> think it is ok, diode goes drain-to-source on selected FET
 -> source is the outer pin (drain middle)
